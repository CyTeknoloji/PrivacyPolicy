PRIVACY POLICY
 
As Cy Tech, we respect and value your privacy.
What third parties collect through our apps
We receive some information automatically when you use our mobile apps. This includes data about your device, software, operating system (OS), the language you set for your Device, advertising IDs for ad tracking (Ad IDs), and your IP address.
We do not collect personally identifiable information about you or your children through our apps. In other words, we do not collect information such as your name, phone number, address or e-mail address.
When you make in-app purchases on our apps, we do not collect or have access to your name and billing information. This information is collected and stored by your platform (Android Google Play) or platform payment processor.
A few of our Apps may use Google Analytics (third party scripts) that collect the following information and may store such information (as well) as a cookie on the device you use to access our Apps:
Google Analytics:
Demographics (browser language, country, city)
Mobile (operating system, screen resolution, service provider)
System information (operating system, browser, service provider)
Site behavior (pages users visit, duration of visit)

How do we use this information collected in our mobile applications?
We collect this information to improve the performance and reliability of our apps and to better understand what users prefer and help improve our app. We do not associate any of this information with individuals or any other information we may obtain. We do not sell, share or otherwise give this information to other people or companies. We do not rent or sell your email address.
Our mobile apps comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). In the event that a user identifies as a child under the age of 13 through a support request or feedback, we will not collect, store or use such user's personal information and will securely delete it.
We take care to filter out categories of ads that are sensitive and inappropriate for children. However, an advertiser may seldom misclassify your ads, which is out of our reach.

We use cookies to improve the quality of our service by storing user preferences and tracking usage information. Most browsers allow you to disable cookies or set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent to your computer.
